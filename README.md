# Vibe Coding Experiment

## General
Followed [Nicholas Zullo's](https://x.com/NicolasZu) [Ultimate Guide to Vibe Coding](https://github.com/EnzeD/vibe-coding) to build a simple karaoke game. The purpose of this exercise was to familiarize myself with AI tools, such as Gemini and Cursor. 

## Takeways 
1. **Extensive Planning Phase:** A significant portion of time (3 hours) was dedicated to design and planning, which included collaborating with Gemini to develop the game design document. The primary focus was on identifying, researching, and mitigating potential technical risks. Gemini's ability to identify technical challenges from feature lists was particularly impressive and felt like genuine intelligence.
2. **Cursor Rules Impact Uncertain:** The effectiveness of the applied cursor rules is unclear, indicating a need for further investigation and understanding in this area of AI coding. It's suspected that incorrect rule types were selected.
3. **Valuable Implementation Plan:** Gemini's implementation plan, which detailed small, verifiable steps, was highly appreciated. This type of document would be beneficial for planning and providing estimates.
4. **Tedious Verification Process:** Verifying each step of Cursor's implementation was tedious, resembling QA work more than creative coding. This process detracted from the gratifying aspect of seeing code come to life.
5. **Difficult Debugging:** Debugging proved to be significantly more challenging compared to traditional coding due to the "black box" nature of the AI-generated code, which was consolidated into a single `main.js` file. This made it hard for a human to read and understand. Cursor rules might have mitigated this. Traditional debugging strategies, which rely on understanding the code, were less effective, leaving only the symptoms of the bug as starting points.
6. **Iterative Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning with AI required several iterations. When the app was built directly, adjustments were clearer and quicker. With AI, descriptions of desired tweaks often resulted in unintended or excessive changes, suggesting a need for more precise communication with the AI.

## Conclusion
The exercise gave me insight on how AI can be effectively leveraged in the coding process and areas requiring further exploration. More time and energy can be spent on the technical design of an application. Implementation is almost an after thought.
