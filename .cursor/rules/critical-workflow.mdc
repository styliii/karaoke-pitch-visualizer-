# Critical Workflow Rules

- **Always read** [architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/architecture.md) before writing any code. This file should include the entire database schema.
- **Always read** [game-design-document.md](mdc:memory-bank/game-design-document.md) before writing any code.
- **After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update** [architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/architecture.md).
