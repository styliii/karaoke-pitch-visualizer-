# Project Structure Guide

- Documentation and planning resources are in the [memory-bank](mdc:memory-bank) directory.
- Cursor-specific rules are stored in the [.cursor/rules](mdc:.cursor/rules) directory, each as a `.mdc` file.
- The main asset for pitch visualization is [Love_Story_-_Taylor_Swift.mid](mdc:Love_Story_-_Taylor_Swift.mid).
